Hi Joshua,

I’ve been thinking about us a lot lately, and I want to start by saying how much I appreciate all the happy moments we’ve shared. We've had so many great times together, from laughing over silly jokes to celebrating our little victories. Being with you brought so much joy into my life, and I’m grateful for every smile and every shared memory. You’ve truly been a wonderful part of my life, and I’ll always cherish those moments.

But lately, I’ve felt some things that have been harder to ignore. There have been moments where I felt frustrated, like we weren’t quite on the same page anymore. It’s tough to say this because I know we’ve both tried our best, but sometimes it felt like we were pulling in different directions. I think these frustrations have been building for both of us, and it hasn’t been fair to either of us. I didn’t want to let it get to this point, but I think we owe it to ourselves to acknowledge what’s been hard and move on to what’s best for us individually.

This is hard for me, and it hurts to say goodbye. Despite everything, I’m really going to miss you. I never wanted to lose you from my life, and part of me wishes things could be different. But I believe this is the right decision for both of us. I hope you find all the happiness and love you deserve, and that maybe someday we can look back on our time together with nothing but warmth. 
Thank you for everything.
Signed, Montgumery
