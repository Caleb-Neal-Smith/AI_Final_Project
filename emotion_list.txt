You're amazing.
Haha, go for it.
This is stupid.
You're wasting my time.
That is a fitting match.
We're proud of this work.
I have no idea what's going on.
Can you please tell me more?
This is not as good as I expected.
This is not as good as it should be.
I felt so self-conscious and awkward.
Looking forward to it!
I'm scared to death.
Thank you so much.
What a beautiful day to be alive!
I'm sorry for your loss.
We'll be there in 20 minutes.
The future is full of promise.
That makes me feel so much better.
I'm sorry about that.
Yuck, get it away!
I feel so miserable.
Wow, that's so unexpected!
I can only imagine what you're going through.
