I'm going to punch you, I am so mad at you!!
I think you are awesome and really cool. You are one of the greatest people I have ever met.
What do you think about TacoBell?
I have no idea what's going on.
Wow, you did an incredible job! I’m really impressed by your dedication.
That joke was hilarious—I can’t stop laughing!
I can't believe they would do something like that; it’s absolutely unacceptable.
For the fifth time, can you please stop doing that?
That’s exactly what I was hoping for; keep it up!
I noticed that everyone seems a little on edge today.
I know I’ve prepared well, so I’m ready to handle whatever comes my way.
I’m not sure if I understand—could you explain that again?
I wonder why that happens... Do you think there's a scientific explanation?
I can’t wait to get started; this is going to be amazing!
I was really hoping for a better outcome; this is a letdown.
I don’t think that’s the right approach; it feels misguided.
I can’t believe I just did that; I’m so embarrassed.
This is absolutely thrilling! I can hardly contain my excitement!
I’m not sure about this; it’s making me a bit uneasy.
Thank you so much for your help—it truly means a lot to me.
This is one of the best days ever; I feel like I'm walking on sunshine!
I care about you deeply and will always be here for you.
Their loss has left a huge void; it’s hard to imagine life without them.
I don’t have strong feelings about this one way or the other.
I really believe that things are going to get better soon.
I’m so glad that worked out; a huge weight has been lifted.
I deeply regret what happened, and I wish I could change it.
That’s absolutely disgusting; I can’t even look at it.
I’ve been feeling down lately; it’s been a tough time.
I can’t stop thinking about what might go wrong.
I didn’t see that coming at all—what a shock!
I’m here for you, and I truly understand what you’re going through.
