You can use the diff language tag to generate some colored text:

$${\color{red}Im \space going \space to \space punch \space you, \space I \space am \space so \space mad \space at \space you!! \space (this would be RED)}$$
$${\color{blue}I \space think \space you \space are \space awesome \space and \space really \space cool. \space You \space are \space one \space of \space the \space greatest \space people \space I \space have \space ever \space met. \space (this \space would \space be \space BLUE)}$$
$${\color{lightblue}What \space do \space you \space think \space about \space TacoBell? \space (this \space would \space be \space CYAN)}$$
I have no idea what's going on.
$${\color{green}I \space have \space no \space idea \space what's \space going \space on. \space (this \space would \space be \space Green}$$
